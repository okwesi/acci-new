        <B class=text-danger>THE BIBLE:</B>
        We believe that the Bible, comprising the old and New Testaments as originally given, is the inspired
        and infallible word of God. It is therefore the sole and sufficient rule in all matters of faith, conduct and
        practice (2 Tim. 3:16, 17; 2 Pet 1:20, 21).
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0px;" class="text-primary p-history m-4">
        <B class=text-danger>THE ONE TRUE GOD:</B>
        We believe in the existence and unity of the Godhead the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
        as equally divine, eternal and personal, and in the sovereignty of God in creation providence and redemption.
        (Gen 1:1; Isa 6:3; Matt. 3:16-17; Jn. 5:7)
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0px;" class="text-primary p-history m-4">
        <B class=text-danger>THE ONE TRUE GOD:</B>
        By the grace of God, The Apostle’s Continuation Church has established churches in several countries around the
        world making it an international body globally recognized. Among these countries are the United Kingdom (UK), in
        United States of America (USA), Germany, Canada, Netherlands, France, Italy, Belgium and Spain.

        <B class=text-danger>MAN’S DEPRIVED NATURE:</B>
        We believe that human nature since the fall of mankind is universally sinful and guilty,
        rendering mankind subject to God’s wrath and condemnation; and need repentance and regeneration. (Gen 3:1-19;
        Isa 53:6, Acts 2:38; Acts 17:30, Gen 3:3; 2Pet 1:4)
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0px;" class="text-primary p-history m-4">
        <B class=text-danger>THE SAVIOUR:</B>
        We believe that redemption from the guilt, penalty and power of sin is ONLY through the sacrificial Death,
        Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ; His intercession and second coming (John 1:1, 8:46, 14:30, 20:28,
        Col 1:15,
        2Cor 5:19, Rom 3:25, Acts 2:36, Phil 2:9-11, Heb 9:24, 1 Thes 4:16-17, Luke 21:17, Rev 22:20)
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0px;" class="text-primary p-history m-4">
        <B class=text-danger>REPENTANCE, JUSTIFICATION AND SANCTIFICATION:</B>
        We believe all men have to repent from their sinful nature, confess their
        sins and believe on the vicarious death of Christ Jesus before they can be justified before God. We believe in
        the
        necessity of the work of the Holy Spirit in conviction, conversion and the indwelling work of the spirit in the
        believer
        and in God’s gift of eternal life. (Rom 3:4; Gal 5:16-17, 5:22-23; Rom 6:23, 8:11; John 10:28)

    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0px;" class="text-primary p-history m-4">
        <B class=text-danger>THE CHURCH:</B>
        We believe that the one Holy Universal Church, to which all who truly believe belong, is the Body of Christ.
        It is by nature one and a unity, uniformity being unnecessary to it.

    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0px;" class="text-primary p-history m-4">
        <B class=text-danger>THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM:</B>
        We believe in the sacrament of Baptism by immersion in water as a clear testimony of a convert
        who has attained responsible age (15 years, Mk. 16:16; Lk 3:21). Infants and children are however DEDICATED to
        the Lord
        (Lk. 2:22-24, 34; Mk 16:16)
    </p>
    <div class="text-primary p-history m-4">
        <B class=text-danger>BAPTISM AND GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT:</B>
        We believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit for believers with signs following
        the operation of the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit according to (1Cor 12:8-11, Mk 16:17; Acts 2:4; Gal
        5:22)

    </div>
    <div class="text-primary p-history m-4">
        <B class=text-danger> NEXT LIFE:</B>
        We believe in the personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Resurrection of both believers and
        non-believers, and the judgment of the world by Him, the eternal blessedness of the righteous and mankind
        (unrighteous)
        to eternal punishment (damnation). (Rom 2:7; 6:2, 1Jn 1:2, 2:25; Rev 2:7; Job 19:26; Jn 5:28; 11:23; 1Cor 15:2;
        Col 3:3;
        2Pet 1:11)
